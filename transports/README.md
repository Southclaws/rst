# transports

A transport is a method of interfacing with the application using a particular protocol. Some applications may have a few transport protocols like HTTP, gRPC and graphql. Yes I included graphql there because what matters is the actual interface with which the user is interacting with. You could shove command line handlers in here if you wanted to!
